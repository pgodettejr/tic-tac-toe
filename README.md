# tic-tac-toe
The second project in the Intermediate level vanilla JS course for The Odin Project. This project involves creating a game of Tic Tac 
Toe that users can play in their web browser. This project will test knowledge of Factory Functions, including Closures, private
variables and functions and how prototypal inheritance works with factories. It will also test IIFE knowledge and the module pattern 
that comes with IIFEs.
